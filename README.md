The ResNet.ipynb file consists of the training procedure for achieving a 90% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset with a constraint of having <5M parameters in the Convolutional Neural Network as the result of Mini-Project 1.

The GRU.ipynb and GAN.ipynb files consist of the training procedures for generating MNIST images from AudioMNIST speech and consists of the AutoEncoder and DCGAN parts, respectively. This is intended to be a temporary representation of the two parts of the problem statement and is the result of Mini-Project 2. The necessary further changes will be reflected upon integration of both modules for the resultant output of Mini-project 3.
